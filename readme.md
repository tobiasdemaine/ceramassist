Cerramassit
===========

A workflow and documentation suite for ceramic artists
------------------------------------------------------

Ceramassist was never intended to be a software title.  It was created as a learning tool to help expedite my knowledge and learning in the art of ceramics. I use ceramassist as part my art practice.  The software runs on web server powered by php5 with the sqlite and curl extensions installed.  There is no authentication or security on the application as it is intended to be used locally.
